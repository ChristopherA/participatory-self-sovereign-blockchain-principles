# Participatory Self-Sovereign Blockchain Principles

AKA What do end users expect from blockchain technologies?

*Seeking improvements! Please post questions or improvements in the [issues](https://github.com/ChristopherA/participatory-self-sovereign-blockchain-principles/issues) list.*

1. Everyone is a peer — no privileged positions. No centrality — every peer is the root of their own network.

2. All can discover peers in the network, and associate with them freely (or not) as they choose.

3. All peers have equal access — including both censorship resistance & low barriers to economic participation.

4. Costs of participation in the network are proportional to the benefits of the network.

5. All peers can be both producers or consumers.

6. Peers can accrue value from participation, such value is persistent and can’t be taken away from them by force.

7. Peers can be held accountable to their commitments without use of force.
8. Peers are incentivized to share knowledge, access to markets, and capital to new peers.
9. Peers and the network as a whole are resilient against the activities of bad actors.

10. Peers are more than their sum of their transactions — they do not exist solely in digital form. ៚

The above is a synthesis of ideas from [Self-Sovereign Identity Principles](https://github.com/ChristopherA/self-sovereign-identity/blob/master/self-sovereign-identity-principles.md), [Participatory Ecosystem Definition](http://www.participatoryecosystem.com/) and [A Revised Ostroms Design Principles for Collective Governance of the Commons](http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2015/11/a-revised-ostroms-design-principles-for-collective-governance-of-the-commons-.html) as applied to what users want from blockchain technologies.

This list inspired by a complaint by @agropper at the W3C Blockchain Community F2F April 24th 2017 in Paris, about too large a focus on big company-centric use cases.
